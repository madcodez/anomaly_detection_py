In this project we will be doing the step by step automation of Anomaly detection. This project will essentially be using Kinesis, SNS, EC2, S3, DynamoDB and lambda handler. In each step some of the services will be provisioned through Cloud formation, which in turn will automate the mentioned tasks. In the next step, a few more services such as CodeDeploy will be provisioned to increase the automation part. In the last Task, the lambda handler part will be provisioned by using cloud formation.
